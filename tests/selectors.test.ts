/**
 * Store-selector hygiene.
 *
 * ── The bug this exists to prevent ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The capstone page shipped blank. Not wrong — blank, which is why it read as
 * "not built". One line did it:
 *
 *     const recorded = useProgress((s) => s.sims[CAPSTONE_SIM_ID]?.tasksDone ?? [])
 *
 * On a store where that sim has never been touched — every first visit — the
 * selector returns a NEW array each call. zustand compares selector output with
 * `Object.is`, so it looked changed on every render: render → fresh array →
 * render. React bailed out with error #185 and unmounted the tree.
 *
 * Nothing caught it. The unit suite has no DOM, so it cannot observe a render
 * loop. The browser e2e visited the route and passed, because it was measuring
 * the Suspense fallback and navigated away before the loop began. Both holes are
 * now fixed, but neither fix is cheap to rely on: the e2e needs a network, a
 * build and a browser.
 *
 * This test is the cheap one. It reads the source and fails on the SHAPE of the
 * mistake, in milliseconds, with no DOM at all. A selector must return a
 * primitive or a stable reference from the store — never a value the selector
 * itself constructs.
 *
 * ── Why not an eslint rule ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A rule would be better placed and worse understood. The failure message here
 * can explain the whole mechanism, which is what someone hitting it at 2am needs.
